# AtomArranger
Uses Atom 2/AUM/Senode/Loopy Pro to arrange and record MIDI

This AUM session demonstrates the use of Senode to sequence Atom 2 instances.  It also comes with an optional Loopy Pro interface to try and improve navigation.  This is an iPad only session I am afraid as Senode is not available for the iPhone.

Senode lets you graphically arrange nodes and is typically used as a single note or chord sequencer.  This AUM session uses each Senode node to drive a different Atom 2 node for a certain number of bars and means that you can use the power of Senodeâ€™s sequencer to create song structures.  For the more adventurous, Senode also has an interesting probability mode which allows you to assign the likelihood of moving from one node to another.  In this context, you could set Senode up to play a sequence of musical parts in a loop, but each time around the loop have the chance of it sounding slightly different, depending on which Atom 2 nodes were randomly triggered.

There is a 4 and 8 track version of the session.  If you know that you will not need more than 4 tracks then this version is recommended as it is easier on the eyes and iPad resources.

I do not recommend that you buy any apps just for the purposes of trying this session out unless you can afford to, or unless you can get some use out of them independently from this AUM session.

The following apps are required:

1. Senode (iPad only I am afraid) - https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/senode-graph-sequencer/id1298766877 
2. Atom 2 https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/atom-piano-roll-2/id1536259776

4. StreamByter (free) - https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/streambyter/id1398712641

The following apps are optional:

1. mfxStrip (you do not need this if you have a controller which can easily switch MIDI output channel but you will need to wire it up yourself in AUM!) - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mfxstrip/id1451194722
2. Loopy Pro (for the user interface, not sure if the free version will work or not) - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/loopy-pro-looper-daw-sampler/id1492670451
3. Tonality (if you care about seeing the musical notes on a staff) - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tonality-music-theory/id1467552236
